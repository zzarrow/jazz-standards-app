##The Real Jazz Standards App for Windows Phone##

####Developed by Zach Zarrow####

Jazz musicians sometimes need to look up lead sheets ("outlines" of songs) for jazz standards.  A very popular and standardized solution for this exists on iOS and Android, but Windows Phone users had nothing.

So, I developed this app - A jazz standards lookup app in its absolutely simplest form, for Windows Phone.  I originally coded this solely for my own personal use.  However, once other jazz musicians with Windows Phone saw it, they requested that I publish it so that they could purchase it.  I polished it up, shipped it, and sold ~500 copies worldwide @ $3.99.

I recently took down the app, as I plan to rebuild it from scratch to allow for a more robust feature set.
